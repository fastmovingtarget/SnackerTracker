# SnackerTracker
Food diary and symptom tracker

## The Problem:
- All the apps we could find to track food and drink intake, as well as any symptoms or impacts thereof, have been gated behind a signup.
- Seeing this, we wanted to build a simple, lightweight mobile app to store food eaten each day and symptoms experienced.

## Basic Ideas/MVP
- Information should be stored locally, both to remove API development time and to prevent the user from having to store their potentially sensitive data elsewhere.
- Initially, we'll just keep to a couple of simple text input forms: one for a new meal, one for the day's feelings/symptoms.
- No need for multiple tabs or routing at present.

## MS1
- Store an ingredient/calorie breakdown for each meal

## MS2
- Store things like sleep, exercise and weather data - that are not directly food, but do have relevance to physical and emotional wellbeing

## MS3
- Pattern tracking and data visualisation - probably in a new tab - need to get measurable metrics for how the user feels.
- Maybe find a way to break down a meal into nutritional value - might require AI support?
